        <p class="thoughts">"Art that Kills" When I saw this it reminded me of something my highschool art teacher told me. When I was a senior working on my parsons challenge I wanted to make this piece that I knew would be incredibly important to me. My only issue was that the topic is a bit off-putting. this piece is about a very personal thing I went through so I was scared it would make people uncomfortable. When I told my teacher my idea he told me something I'll never forget. He said "sometimes art is meant to be uncomfortable" and while that sentence alone may seem insignificant, to me it was so eye opening. As an artist I can create whatever I want, It doesn't matter what other people think of it cause its mine. So whether its "art that kills" or art that makes you feel happy, or sad etc. as long as the art conveys the message, thats all that matters.  </p>
